# Blood Bank Management System

Welcome to the Blood Bank Management System repository! This project aims to create a user-friendly and efficient platform for managing blood donation and distribution activities. Whether you're a blood donor, recipient, or an administrator, this system simplifies the process of matching blood donors with recipients and tracking blood inventory.

## Features

- **User Roles**: The system supports three main user roles - Donors, Recipients, and Administrators, each with specific privileges and actions they can perform.

- **Donation and Request**: Donors can register, update their information, and schedule blood donation appointments. Recipients can create blood donation requests based on their needs.

- **Inventory Management**: Administrators can manage the blood inventory, updating quantities, expiration dates, and types of blood available.

- **Matching Algorithm**: The system includes an algorithm to match available blood with recipient requests, ensuring compatibility based on blood type and availability.

- **Notifications**: Donors and recipients receive notifications about appointment confirmations, successful donations, and matched requests.

- **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile page displaying their details, donation history, and previous requests.
